# Hey and welcome

You're reading this `README`, and that means you've managed to get into the second (and final) round of the application process at Fronius. **Congratulations!** It's really great to have you here, and we really appreciate that you're taking the time for the second round with us. We know that applying for jobs can be daunting and stressful. But now that we know a little bit more about who you are, we also want get a glimpse on how you solve problems - so we have brought you a small challenge for you to solve.

The challenge consists out of 2 C#/.NET projects. `Fronius.Onboarding.SelfVerficiation` implements Tests that `FAIL` when you start. Each Testcase in this project includes a short description of what the test verifies/asserts - and what you are supposed to implement, to make it `PASS`. Your final goal is to make (ideally) all tests `PASS`. To achieve this, you have to implement your solution inside the `Fronius.Onboarding` project. Some interfaces are defined there already - it's your task to create the corresponding implementations.

After you have finished we'll discuss your solution together and refactor things a little bit if necessary. 



## Rules

- Please do **NOT** change the Testcases inside the `Fronius.Onboarding.SelfVerficiation` project
- Please do **NOT** change the Interfaces already existing inside the `Fronius.Onboarding` project
- Most importantly: don't stress yourself. You won't have time-pressure. `quality > quick delivery`
- That's it! No more rules.

## Requirements

- [x] (ideally) a IDE supporting C#/.NET (e.g. Visual Studio, Jetbrains Rider, Visual Studio Code, or whatever preference you have)
- [x] .NET SDK 8.0 installed on the machine you're working on

---

## The small print

Don't worry if you cannot make all Tests `PASS`. We know that this is not a comfortable situation to be in. If you faced any troubles, make sure to describe what you have tried later on. We'll make it work together and discuss your solution afterwards. Also, if you have any question in the meanwhile, please feel free to ask at any point - asking for help is highly appreciated. Also, in case of doubt, feel free to utilize any Online-Help needed.
